Musician's Post is a social media platform that allows musicians to find other musicians with similar tastes with the purpose of meeting up locally to practice and perform. Users will have a profile tailored by their favorite music genres, instruments played, and location by zip code. Users will also have access to a news feed that is influenced by their saved zip code to make meeting up easier.  The application is built utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Nodemon, Sequelize, Handlebars, and Jest.
